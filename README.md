# Implicit Type Conversion Bug in C#

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to implicit type conversion operators in C#. The code involves a class with implicit conversion operators to and from integers. While the conversions work as expected in simple cases, combining them with arithmetic operations can lead to unexpected and difficult-to-debug behavior.

The `bug.cs` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.cs` offers a potential solution and explanation.

## Potential Solutions

The best solution depends on the specific context.  Consider:

1. **Explicit Conversions:** Replace implicit conversions with explicit ones to make the type changes more apparent.
2. **Operator Overloading Review:** Carefully review the logic of the operator overloading methods. Ensure they behave predictably in all scenarios.
3. **Enhanced Debugging:** Use a debugger to step through the code and observe the type changes at each step.
4. **Code Comments:** Improve code readability by adding comments to explain the intent of implicit conversions.
